    "In this lab, we will consider the problem of finding the shortest path on a graph with a special structure, widely used in robotics and computer games — a grid. The grid consists of both free and blocked cells, and an agent can move from one free cell to another. The connectivity of the grid may vary; for example, a grid might be 4-connected when only cardinal moves (N, E, W, S) are allowed, or 8-connected when diagonal moves are allowed as well.\n",
